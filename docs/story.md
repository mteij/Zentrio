# The Story Behind Zentrio

Zentrio started in late 2024 as a weekend project with a simple goal: solve a long-standing [community feature request](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-features/issues/622) for user profile management.

## The Beginning

The initial concept was straightforward—a profile switcher overlay that could manage multiple user configurations. A quick proof-of-concept, maybe a few hundred lines of code, and the problem would be solved.

But as is often the case with side projects, scope expanded.

## Evolution

What started as a profile manager evolved as new possibilities emerged. Why just switch profiles when you could have a dedicated interface? Why rely on external apps when you could integrate playback directly? Each feature opened doors to the next.

The project grew from a simple utility into a complete streaming platform:

- Profile management became account management with full authentication
- A basic UI became a polished, glassmorphic design system
- Addon support became a full ecosystem of content sources
- Browser-only became cross-platform with Tauri

## Built with AI

Zentrio was built primarily through AI pair-programming—an experiment in what's possible when modern coding assistants work alongside a developer's vision. The vast majority of the codebase was generated and refined through conversation, with human guidance on architecture and design decisions.

This approach allowed a single engineering student to build something that would traditionally require a team. It also means the project carries the experimental nature of AI-assisted development—functional and feature-rich, but always evolving.

## Today

Zentrio now stands as an independent streaming platform. While it maintains compatibility with community addons, its core functionality requires no external dependencies. It's designed for self-hosting, privacy, and customization.

The project remains open source and welcomes contributions from anyone interested in pushing it further.
