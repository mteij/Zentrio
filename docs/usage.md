# Welcome to Zentrio

[Public Instance](https://app.zentrio.eu)

Zentrio is designed to be your all-in-one streaming hub, offering a personalized and highly customizable experience across all your devices. Whether you are managing multiple users under one roof or tuning your streaming setup to perfection, Zentrio provides the tools you need in a modern, clean interface.

## Core Features

### Profiles

Keep everyone's watch history and preferences strictly separated. Just like major streaming services, you can create multiple profiles under a single account. Each profile maintains its own "Continue Watching" list, visual preferences (like showing IMDb or age ratings), and streaming settings.

### Addons

Zentrio's content library is powered by the community. You can easily install addons to extend your streaming sources and discover new media. Simply drop an addon manifest URL into your settings, and Zentrio handles the rest, allowing you to reorder sources to prioritize your preferred streams.

### Settings & Customization

Take full control over your experience. You can tweak everything from your default streaming quality and subtitle preferences to proxy settings and debrid service integrations. Zentrio also supports secure account management, including Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and social logins (SSO) via Google, GitHub, or Discord.

### Multi-Platform Access

Zentrio is built to go wherever you go:

- **Web & PWA**: Access your library from any browser, or install the Progressive Web App (PWA) on iOS/Android for a native app-like experience without needing an app store.
- **Native Apps**: Dedicated applications are available for both Desktop and Android, which you can find on our [Releases page](https://zentrio.eu/releases).
