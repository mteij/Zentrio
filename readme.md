## 📜 Origin Story

Zentrio started as a weekend project inspired by a [community feature request](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-features/issues/622) for profile management. What began as a simple profile switcher evolved into something much larger.

As development progressed, the vision expanded beyond its original scope. A truly great experience required more than just profile switching—it needed a dedicated interface, better content discovery, and a cohesive design. Today, Zentrio stands as its own independent streaming platform with support for community addons.
