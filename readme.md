<summary><font size="+2"><b>⚠️ Disclaimer: Built with AI</b></font></summary>

Zentrio was built with substantial assistance from AI tooling, guided by an engineering student exploring what these tools make possible. I invite everyone to try Zentrio with the thought that it might contain imperfections. **Please use it at your own risk.**

## 🚀 Getting Started

Zentrio is easiest to explore via the public instance, visit our website for more information:
- 🌐 Zentrio.eu: [**zentrio.eu**](https://zentrio.eu)

For deployment, self-hosting, and development setup instructions, refer to the documentation.

## 📖 What is Zentrio?

Zentrio is a modern, self-hosted streaming platform improving upon similar existing platforms with features like multi-profile support, a Stremio compatible addon system and a downloads feature (Coming soon).

### The story behind Zentrio

Zentrio started as a weekend project inspired by a [community feature request](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-features/issues/622) for profile management. Initially it was an application that proxied stremio web in a hacky way while allowing users to switch profiles easily. However, after stumbling upon the limitations of this concept, I decided to build a standalone platform to my liking.

### Vibe-coding and my POV

Zentrio was made possible by todays modern technologies and AI tools, insinuating that Zentrio is largly vibe coded and more a proof of concept for AI in software development than a finished product. Feel free to enjoy Zentrio or stay far away if you are critical about this.
