## Origin Story

Zentrio started as a weekend project to solve [this community issue](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-features/issues/622) regarding Stremio profiles. The initial goal was simple: provide a way to manage multiple users on Stremio Web.

However, as development progressed, the vision expanded. We realized that a truly great experience required more than just profile switching—it needed a dedicated interface, better discovery, and a more cohesive design. Today, Zentrio stands as its own platform, compatible with the Stremio ecosystem but offering a distinct, refined experience.
