Hey there! Just so you know, Zentrio was built mostly with AI assistance — it's been a fun experiment in what's possible when you combine AI tools with a curious engineering student.

While I'm proud of what we've created, I'm also being honest: this is an experimental vibe-coded project, and I can't guarantee everything is perfect. **Please use at your own risk**, and I'd recommend using unique credentials rather than your main Stremio account — better safe than sorry!

## About Zentrio

Zentrio started as a weekend project to solve [this community issue](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-features/issues/622) regarding Stremio profiles, but it's grown into something I'm genuinely excited about. Now everyone in your household can have their own space, no more "why is my continue watching full of (insert random movie)?"
