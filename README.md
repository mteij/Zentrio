Zentrio was built with substantial assistance from AI tooling, guided by an engineering student exploring what these tools make possible.

Although the project is maintained with care, it remains experimental and may contain imperfections. **Please use it at your own risk**, and consider using unique credentials instead of your primary Stremio account for additional safety.

## About Zentrio

Zentrio started as a weekend project to solve [this community issue](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-features/issues/622) regarding Stremio profiles, but it's grown into something bigger. Not only does Zentrio create a seperate space but its also bundled with a lot of QoL features that hope to make the already awesome Stremio experience even better!
