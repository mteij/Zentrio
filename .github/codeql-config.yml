# Suppress false-positive rules for React JSX applications.
# js/xss-through-dom flags React <img src={...}> as "DOM text reinterpreted
# as HTML" when data flows from localStorage/API responses. React sets element
# attributes via DOM property assignment (element.src = value), NOT innerHTML.
# Combined with our allowlist-based sanitizeImgSrc() utility (only permits
# http:, https:, blob:, or relative / URLs), this is defense-in-depth.
